AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is Amazon's serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger.

Features:
- Automatic scaling from zero to thousands
- Pay per request and compute time
- Integrated with AWS services
- Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and more

Lambda functions can be triggered by S3 events, DynamoDB streams, API Gateway, and many other AWS services.
