Docker and Containerization

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure consistency across environments.

Key Concepts:
- Images: Read-only templates with application code
- Containers: Running instances of images
- Dockerfile: Instructions to build custom images
- Docker Hub: Registry for sharing images

Benefits:
- Consistent environments from development to production
- Efficient resource utilization compared to VMs
- Fast startup times
- Easy scaling and orchestration with Kubernetes

Docker revolutionized how developers build and deploy applications.
