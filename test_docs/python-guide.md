# Python Programming Guide

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, it has become one of the most popular languages for web development, data science, and automation.

## Getting Started

Python emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. The language is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.

### Installation

You can install Python from python.org or use a package manager like Homebrew on macOS.

## Use Cases

- Web development (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Data analysis and machine learning (Pandas, TensorFlow)
- Automation and scripting
- Scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy)

Python's extensive standard library and package ecosystem (PyPI) make it suitable for almost any task.
